  <h1>Amethyst</h1>
</div>

Amethyst is a dark, minimal, modern rework of Discord's UI that touches (almost) everything. It includes a darker, purple-y-er colour scheme, many UI tweaks, and lots of quality-of-life changes (e.g., hidden nitro gift buttons, upsells, reordered UI elements, increased contrast)

## Install ðŸŽ¨
[Download](https://github.com/kiosion/Amethyst/releases/latest/download/amethyst.theme.css) the theme and move `amethyst.theme.css` into your clients' themes folder. Amethyst should be recognised & supported by most clients, although it's only been tested with Astra, BetterDiscord, and Powercord.

## Issues ðŸ™‹
This is just a side project; it's not visually perfect by any means and certainly isn't optimized well. Check out [TODO.md](https://github.com/kiosion/Amethyst/tree/master/TODO.md) for a complete list of issues I'm working on.
