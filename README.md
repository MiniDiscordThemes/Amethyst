Amethyst is a dark, minimal, and modern rework of Discord's UI. Contains darker, purple-y-er colours, UI tweaks, and lots of miscellaneous quality-of-life changes (hiding nitro gift buttons, upsells, reorganizing UI elements, etc).

## Install 🎨

## Issues 🙋
This is just a pet project of mine; it's not visually perfect by any means. Check out [TODO.md](https://github.com/kiosion/Amethyst/tree/master/TODO.md) for a complete list of issues I'm working on.
