<div align=center><h1>Amethyst</h1></div>

Amethyst is my fork of the Zelk BetterDiscord theme, using a <a href="https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme" target="_blank">Dracula</a>-inspired colour scheme along with some other tweaks and quality-of-life changes.

### INSTALL
Download and move the `amethyst.theme.css` file into your BetterDiscord themes folder.

### PREVIEW
For previews of the theme, click [here](https://github.com/kiosion/Amethyst/tree/master/preview)

### ISSUES
This is just a pet project of mine; it's not visually perfect by any means. Check out [TODO.md](https://github.com/kiosion/Amethyst/tree/master/TODO.md) for a complete list of issues I'm working on.
