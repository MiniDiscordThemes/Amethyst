Amethyst is a dark, minimal, and modern rework of Discord's UI that touches (almost) every element. It includes darker, purple-y-er colours, UI tweaks, and lots of miscellaneous quality-of-life changes - hiding nitro gift buttons, upsells, reorganizing UI elements, etc.

## Preview 🔎

## Install 🎨
[Download](https://github.com/kiosion/Amethyst/releases/latest/download/amethyst.theme.css) and move `amethyst.theme.css` into your clients' themes folder. Amethyst should be recognised & supported by most clients, although it's only tested on Astra, BetterDiscord, and Powercord.

## Issues 🙋
This is just a pet project of mine; it's not visually perfect by any means. Check out [TODO.md](https://github.com/kiosion/Amethyst/tree/master/TODO.md) for a complete list of issues I'm working on.
